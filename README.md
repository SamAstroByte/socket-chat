# Socket Chat Application

This project implements a simple TCP-based client-server chat system using Python sockets. The server accepts multiple client connections and broadcasts messages between them.

## Features

* TCP communication
* Multi-client support
* Threaded server
* Message broadcasting

## Motivation

This project was built to understand how distributed systems communicate over networks and how concurrent connections are handled.

## Technologies

* Python
* Socket programming
* Multithreading

## What I Learned

* Client-server architecture
* TCP communication fundamentals
* Concurrency in networked applications
